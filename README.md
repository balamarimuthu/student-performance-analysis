# 🏫 Student Performance Analyzer – Python Project by Bala Marimuthu

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a **student report card and leaderboard system**. It allows users to add multiple classes, enter student marks across 5 subjects, calculate totals, averages, grades, and generate a ranked leaderboard for each class.

I created this as part of my learning journey in Python and data handling. It’s a simple but functional command-line tool that shows how object-oriented programming (OOP) can be used to solve real-world problems in education.
